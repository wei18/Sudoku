// LiveRouteFactory+ReplayDailyBoard — the `.replayDailyBoard` destination
// (#841).
//
// Split into its own file purely to keep LiveRouteFactory.swift under the
// 400-line `file_length` lint ceiling (same rationale as `+Stats.swift` /
// `+Helpers.swift`) — this is the same route table, not a separate concern.
// The factory's stored deps are `private` (file-scoped), so the switch
// passes them in rather than the extension reading them.
//
// #841 ("daily retry after loss generates a different board per first click
// — daily must be one fixed game"): a bare `MinesweeperBoardView(difficulty:
// seed:)` re-derives mine placement from THIS replay's own first click (the
// engine's deferred/first-click-salted path), so a different tap on each
// retry silently produced a different board. Routed through
// `MinesweeperDailyReplayLoaderView` instead, which fetches the daily's own
// persisted "failed" record (written by the ORIGINAL first-ever attempt on
// loss) and replays with that exact mine layout. Falls back to the old
// direct-inline construction when no `savedGameStore` is wired
// (preview/test callsites) — byte-identical to pre-#841 behavior there.
