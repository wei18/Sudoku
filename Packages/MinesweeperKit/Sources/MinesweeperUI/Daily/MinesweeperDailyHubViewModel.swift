// MinesweeperDailyHubViewModel — owns the daily trio fetch + completion overlay.
//
// Mirrors `SudokuUI.DailyHubViewModel`: bootstraps by fetching today's trio
// from a `MinesweeperDailyProviding` and the already-completed daily ids from
// Persistence, merging them into three `MinesweeperDailyCard` rows. The
// completion-fetch is graceful-degrade (a failure renders every card
// un-completed, never blocks the hub) — same principle as Sudoku's Daily.
//
// MS generation is synchronous + non-throwing (pure `MinesweeperDaily`), so
// there is no `.exhausted` / generator-failure path; the only async work is
// the optional completed-ids fetch.
