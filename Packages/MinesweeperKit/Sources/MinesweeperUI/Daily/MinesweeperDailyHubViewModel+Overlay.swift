// MinesweeperDailyHubViewModel+Overlay — phase-2 overlay fetches: failed-ids,
// #886 per-difficulty best-DAILY-time, and #774 rolling 7-day completed-ids
// window.
//
// Split out of the main class body purely to keep
// MinesweeperDailyHubViewModel.swift under the 400-line `file_length` lint
// ceiling (#886 pushed it over) — these are not a separate concern, they're
// the same phase-2 overlay-fill logic `fillCompletionAndFailureOverlay` (in
// the main file) calls, same rationale as
// `MinesweeperGameViewModel+SubmitOnWin.swift`. `WeekWindowSlot` is
// `internal` (not `private`) so `fillCompletionAndFailureOverlay`'s inferred
// usage of `fetchWeekWindow`'s return type resolves across the file
// boundary; `savedGameStore` / `personalRecordStore` / `errorReporter` are
// `internal` on the main class for the same cross-file-access reason.
