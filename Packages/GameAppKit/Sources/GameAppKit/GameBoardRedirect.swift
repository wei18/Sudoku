// GameBoardRedirect — zero-content destination that immediately pops itself
// and instead triggers a fullScreenCover presentation via the supplied
// `onPresent` closure.
//
// SDD-003 Epic 1: board routes used to be NavigationStack pushes. They are
// now fullScreenCover modals (R1.1). Hub VMs still call `path.append(.board(...))`
// — touching all hub VMs is a larger, riskier change. Instead, `LiveRouteFactory`
// returns this redirect view for board routes: it fires `onPresent()` (which
// calls `GameRootViewModel.presentGame(route:)`) then removes the route from the
// navigation path, producing a seamless transition from push to modal.
//
// The `path` binding passed by `NavigationStackHost` is the root path; clearing
// the last entry returns the stack to Home while the fullScreenCover appears on top.

/// Shared #491 two-context board-redirect decision.
///
/// Every game's `RouteFactory.view(for:path:)` board cases share the same
/// guard: when `onPresentBoard` is wired AND the route arrived via a
/// NavigationStack push (`path != nil`), return a `GameBoardRedirect` that
/// pops the stack entry and presents the board as a fullScreenCover modal.
/// In the modal context (`path == nil`) GameRoot calls `view(for:path:nil)` to
/// build the real board view — the redirect must NOT fire or the modal renders
/// `Color.clear` (blank screen). The legacy push path (`onPresentBoard == nil`)
/// falls straight through to `buildInline` for tests / previews.
///
/// Centralising the decision here means a future fix to the contract is
/// one edit, not one per game.
